# Miguel Ruiz-Granda

I am a PhD student specializing in observational cosmology, funded by the FPU grant from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities. I hold Bachelor's degrees in both Physics and Mathematics from the [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/). During my final undergraduate projects, I focused on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and applied optimization techniques to industrial processes. My Master's research introduced me to CMB weak lensing, specifically working with data from [Planck](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck) and preparing for the upcoming [LiteBIRD](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/future/litebird.html) space mission. 

Since beginning my PhD in January 2023, under the supervision of Patricio Vielva and Diego Herranz, I have continued my research on CMB lensing within the LiteBIRD collaboration and expanded my focus to include foreground removal for 21 cm Line Intensity Mapping (LIM).

My research interests cover a wide range of cosmological topics. As a physics undergraduate, I explored the accuracy of CMB physical processes modeling and its potential impact on cosmological tensions, such as the Hubble constant. During my Masterâ€™s, I shifted toward studying CMB weak lensing, which examines how gravitational fields subtly affect the path of CMB photons. I am continuing this work in my PhD, investigating how combining Planck and LiteBIRD data can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of lensing detection. Expanding into 21 cm LIM, I participated in the [SKA](https://www.skao.int/en) Data Challenge 3a, focusing on removing foreground contaminants to retrieve the 21 cm Epoch of Reionization signal. I am now building on this by working on foreground removal techniques for low-redshift observations.
