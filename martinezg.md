# Guillermo Martínez-Somonte

Guillermo Martínez-Somonte is a PhD candidate in cosmology at the [Instituto de Física de Cantabria (IFCA, CSIC-UC)](https://ifca.unican.es) in Santander, Spain. He completed his bachelor’s degree in 2016 at the [Universidad de Cantabria](https://web.unican.es) with a final undergraduate project about [large scale power deficit cosmic inflation models](https://repositorio.unican.es/xmlui/handle/10902/9647). In 2018 he completed his master’s degree in [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio), with a master’s final project about balancing HEROES dust energy problem.

Since 2019 he’s been doing research involving Large Scale Structure (LSS), Galaxy Clustering and Bayesian Inference under the supervision of Enrique Martínez-González and Airam Marcos-Caballero. 

The main goal of his research is the implementation and application of a non-parametric Bayesian methodology that reconstructs the Primordial Power Spectrum from LSS observational data, as galaxy power spectra. This methodology aims to spot deviations in the Standard Model’s power law prediction of the Primordial Power Spectrum. These deviations can be linked to multiple features predicted by inflationary models, many of them implying slow-roll departures. This tested methodology is being applied to predictions of upcoming LSS stage IV surveys, as the [Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating universe astrophysical Survey (J-PAS)](https://www.j-pas.org) or the [The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-III (BOSS)](https://www.sdss3.org/science/boss_publications.php) and previously it was applied to catalogues as the [Sloan Sky Digital Survey Luminous Red Galaxy data release 4](https://classic.sdss.org/dr7/start/aboutdr4.php).
