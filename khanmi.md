# Md Ishaque Khan

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Cosmos Sciences](https://icc.ub.edu/), within the [RadioForegroundsPlus collaboration](https://research.iac.es/proyecto/radioforegroundsplus/), which involves active research in Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom. I work on component separation methods to extract astrophysical foregrounds which contaminate the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. We provide point source catalogs and foreground templates for use in possibly uncovering the "smoking gun" of cosmic inflation aka the B-mode polarisation signal of the CMB, in the future.


I obtained my PhD in anomalies in the CMB, from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, India. I have held a postdoctoral position at the Institute of Physics (IOP) Bhubaneswar, India before my current position, wherein I worked on the impact of weakly coupled sterile neutrinos in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the CMB.
