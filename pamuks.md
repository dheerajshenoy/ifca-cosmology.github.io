# Sefa Pamuk

Hello everyone: I am Sefa and I work as a theoretical astrophysicist/cosmologist and work here at the 
IFCA within the cosmology and instrumentation group. I am currently working for obtaining my PhD under the supervision of José Luis Bernal and Mathieu Remazeilles.

I am currently studying the prospect of a new field in cosmology, called line intensity mapping. With this new method we want to probe the state of the Universe at very early times when the formation of the first structures was still ongoing. I am interested in this unique window as this could allow us a glimpse in the evolution of the Universe which is hidden from traditional experiments. While still in its infancy, line intensity mapping has already a devout followership due to its strengths. As a part of this effort, I have joined the MeerKlass project, which uses satellite dishes to scan the sky for signals of neutral hydrogen. Neutral hydrogen is special as it accompanied the evolution of the Universe since the emission of the cosmic microwave background, yet changing drastically regions of space where we can find it. On that regard, it really is like the actors of ancient Greek theatre, playing multiple roles in the same play.

Before working on line intensity mapping, I have been studying the clustering of Galaxies and the distortion of their shapes measured by the Euclid satellite. Euclid is the next big mission of the European space agency after Planck, connecting scientists from all over the globe. It will create the most complete map of the sky over cosmic times of 10 billion years. I studied the potential of this largest map to study the properties of the smallest particle, the neutrino. This interface of particle physics and cosmology is really emblematic of the work at IFCA, "de lo más pequeño a lo más grande". On this field of particle cosmology, I have also studied the nature of gravity. Currently, I am working on performing tests on the fundamental consistency relations of general relativity.

Additionally to this fields I am interested in theoretical classical mathematics, simulations of the universe, pure particle physics, as well as philosophy and politics. On that regard I like to put the "meta" in "metaphysics".
