# Bradley J. Kavanagh

Dr. Bradley J. Kavanagh is a *Científico Titular* (tenured scientist) at IFCA. His research is in particle astrophysics, specifically focusing on the search for Dark Matter. Bradley received his PhD from the University of Nottingham in 2014, and subsequently held post-doc positions at the [LPTHE](http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr) in Paris and at the [GRAPPA](https://iop.fnwi.uva.nl/grappa/) institute at the University of Amsterdam from September 2017 - February 2020. He also briefly held a Ramón y Cajal Fellowship before taking up with permanent research position with CSIC at IFCA.

Bradley's research on Dark Matter focuses on new ways to constrain the properties of this elusive substance. This includes a range of astrophysical and cosmological probes, including searching for the impact of Dark Matter in the gravitational waves emitted by black hole and neutron star binaries. Bradley also collaborates closely with the Particle Physics and Instrumentation group at IFCA, modeling the signals of Dark Matter in a number of lab-based searches, including DAMIC-M and CADEx. As part of his research, Bradley is committed to Open Science, and in particular the public sharing of scientific code, as a way of improving reproducibility and accelerating the progress of physics research.

Bradley is the IFCA representative for the Spanish RENATA Network on Astroparticle Physics. He is also IFCA's representative to the [European Consortium for Astroparticle Theory (EuCAPT)](https://www.eucapt.org) and takes part as an interviewer in the regular [EuCAPT Video Profile](https://www.eucapt.org/profiles) series.
