# Abram Pérez Herrero

I'm a PhD student in Cosmology and Astrophysics, funded by an FPI grant from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/), where my thesis work focused on the search for dark matter, specifically exploring dark matter spike populations and primordial black holes. Since beginning my PhD in March 2024 under the supervision of Diego Herranz and Rafael Guzmán, my research has centered on the ARRAKIHS space mission.

My main research centers on the formation of stellar streams, aiming to utilize their properties to differentiate between different dark matter models. Alongside this main focus, I've contributed to complementary projects, including simulating cosmic ray noise to generate realistic mock images for the ARRAKIHS mission and analyzing dark matter spike population using black hole evolution models.
