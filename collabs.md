The [research lines]({{site.url}}/lines) explored by the members of the Cosmology Group at IFCA are very broad. Given the strong emphasis of the group on observational cosmology, we participate in many collaborations, missions and international projects. You can find some of them below.

### ARRAKIHS
The ARRAKIHS mission (Analysis of Resolved Remnants of Accreted galaxies as a Key Instrument for Halo Surveys) is a cutting-edge European Space Agency (ESA) project designed to explore the ultra-low surface brightness universe. ARRAKIHS aims to tackle one of the most profound questions in modern cosmology: the nature of dark matter. This mission will provide unprecedented data by systematically observing about one hundred nearby galaxy halos, probing the faint remnants of galaxy interactions and dark matter distribution that are invisible to ground-based telescopes.

ARRAKIHS will carry out the most detailed survey ever conducted of galaxy halos down to a surface brightness level of 31 mag/arcsec². By observing visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, ARRAKIHS will collect a unique dataset that will challenge current cosmological models and possibly lead to revisions of the widely accepted Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theory.

ARRAKIHS addresses several key challenges in cosmology, such as the “missing satellites” and “too big to fail” problems, where the number of observed dwarf galaxies in galaxy halos is lower than predicted by CDM models. Through deep imaging, the mission will catalogue previously undetectable satellite galaxies and faint stellar streams—evidence of past galaxy mergers—that hold the key to understanding the hierarchical formation of galaxies and test different dark matter models as a key driver for cosmological evolution.

The mission is the second F-class mission selected by ESA and the first ESA mission led by a Spanish institution. Professor Rafael Guzmán from the Instituto de Física de Cantabria (IFCA) serves as the Principal Investigator. IFCA plays a central role, contributing to the mission's Science and Ground Segment working packages. IFCA also hosts the ARRAKIHS Communication Office, Project Office and Science Data Centre. The ARRAKIHS mission will also complement other major projects like the Euclid mission, offering a broader understanding of dark matter by focusing on the local universe rather than distant, high-redshift galaxies. Thus, ARRAKIHS bridges the observational gap in dark matter research, connecting the microscopic scales explored by particle physics experiments like DAMIC-M with the vast cosmological scales investigated by large-scale projects such as JWST-HST, Euclid, QUIJOTE, and LiteBIRD.

### CADEx

The Canfranc Axion Detection Experiment (CADEx) is a planned search for the Dark Matter axion in the mass range (330–460 μeV) within the W-band (80–110 GHz). CADEx combines a microwave resonant cavity haloscope with a broadband incoherent detector system to be installed in the dilution refrigerator in the Canfranc Underground Lab (LSC). CADEx is currently in the design and development phase.
