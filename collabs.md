### ARRAKIHS
The ARRAKIHS mission (Analysis of Resolved Remnants of Accreted galaxies as a Key Instrument for Halo Surveys) is a cutting-edge European Space Agency (ESA) project designed to explore the ultra-low surface brightness universe. ARRAKIHS aims to tackle one of the most profound questions in modern cosmology: the nature of dark matter. This mission will provide unprecedented data by systematically observing about one hundred nearby galaxy halos, probing the faint remnants of galaxy interactions and dark matter distribution that are invisible to ground-based telescopes.

ARRAKIHS will carry out the most detailed survey ever conducted of galaxy halos down to a surface brightness level of 31 mag/arcsec². By observing visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, ARRAKIHS will collect a unique dataset that will challenge current cosmological models and possibly lead to revisions of the widely accepted Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theory.

ARRAKIHS addresses several key challenges in cosmology, such as the “missing satellites” and “too big to fail” problems, where the number of observed dwarf galaxies in galaxy halos is lower than predicted by CDM models. Through deep imaging, the mission will catalogue previously undetectable satellite galaxies and faint stellar streams—evidence of past galaxy mergers—that hold the key to understanding the hierarchical formation of galaxies and test different dark matter models as a key driver for cosmological evolution.

The mission is the second F-class mission selected by ESA and the first ESA mission led by a Spanish institution. Professor Rafael Guzmán from the Instituto de Física de Cantabria (IFCA) serves as the Principal Investigator. IFCA plays a central role, contributing to the mission's Science and Ground Segment working packages. IFCA also hosts the ARRAKIHS Communication Office, Project Office and Science Data Centre. The ARRAKIHS mission will also complement other major projects like the Euclid mission, offering a broader understanding of dark matter by focusing on the local universe rather than distant, high-redshift galaxies. Thus, ARRAKIHS bridges the observational gap in dark matter research, connecting the microscopic scales explored by particle physics experiments like DAMIC-M with the vast cosmological scales investigated by large-scale projects such as JWST-HST, Euclid, QUIJOTE, and LiteBIRD.

The Canfranc Axion Detection Experiment (CADEx) is a planned search for the Dark Matter axion in the mass range (330–460 μeV) within the W-band (80–110 GHz). CADEx combines a microwave resonant cavity haloscope with a broadband incoherent detector system to be installed in the dilution refrigerator in the Canfranc Underground Lab (LSC). CADEx is currently in the design and development phase.

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST), launched in 1990 by NASA in collaboration with ESA, is one of the most significant astronomical observatories in history. Operating in low Earth orbit, HST has revolutionised our understanding of the universe by providing incredibly detailed images across ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths. Its observations have transformed numerous fields in astronomy, from studying distant galaxies and dark matter to uncovering the mysteries of exoplanets and black holes.

With its unparalleled clarity and resolution, HST has made groundbreaking discoveries, such as confirming the accelerating expansion of the universe—leading to the discovery of dark energy—, providing direct evidence of the existence of supermassive black holes, and capturing the most distant galaxies ever observed. HST's ability to peer deep into the cosmos has enabled scientists to explore galaxy formation and evolution, the life cycles of stars, and the structure of the early universe.

For over 30 years, HST has remained a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, serving as a critical tool for understanding our cosmic origins. It complements missions like JWST and Euclid, providing valuable data on both the local and distant universe.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in 2021 by NASA in partnership with ESA and CSA, is the most advanced space observatory ever built. Designed to study the universe in the infrared spectrum, JWST's cutting-edge technology allows it to see through cosmic dust and capture faint light from the earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang. This mission is set to uncover answers to some of the most profound questions in cosmology, including the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the evolution of planetary systems, and the search for life on exoplanets.

JWST's powerful capabilities include a 6.5-metre primary mirror and a suite of sophisticated instruments that provide unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. Its ability to observe in the infrared spectrum makes it ideal for studying the formation of stars and planets within dense clouds of gas and dust, probing the atmospheres of exoplanets for signs of habitability, and investigating the distant universe's evolution. By pushing the limits of observational astronomy, JWST is expected to offer new insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy, providing critical data to complement other observatories like HST and Euclid.

As the successor to HST, JWST marks the next chapter in space-based astronomy, significantly extending our ability to study both the early universe and the local cosmic neighbourhood, from faint galaxies to nearby star-forming regions.

The Euclid mission, led by the European Space Agency (ESA), is designed to address some of the most profound questions in modern cosmology, particularly concerning the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Launched in 2023, Euclid aims to map the geometry of the universe by observing billions of galaxies across more than a third of the sky, spanning distances of up to 10 billion light-years. This ambitious survey will provide unprecedented data on the large-scale structure of the universe, offering key insights into the distribution of dark matter and the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy.

Euclid’s powerful instruments operate in the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, allowing it to detect faint galaxies and cosmic structures with extraordinary precision. Through its wide-field imaging and spectroscopic capabilities, the mission will measure the shapes, positions, and redshifts of galaxies, enabling scientists to trace the evolution of cosmic structures over time. By studying gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, Euclid will map the distribution of dark matter and test different models of dark energy, shedding light on the mysterious forces shaping the cosmos.

Euclid complements other major observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), but with a unique focus on the large-scale structure of the universe rather than individual galaxies or distant stars. As a cornerstone of ESA’s Cosmic Vision program, Euclid will provide crucial data that could lead to paradigm-shifting discoveries in cosmology, helping to refine or challenge the current standard model of cosmology, the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) model.
