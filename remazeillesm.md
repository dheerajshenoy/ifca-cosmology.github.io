# Mathieu Remazeilles

Mathieu Remazeilles is a Tenured Scientist (Científico Titular) at the [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/es). He conducts his research in cosmology at [IFCA](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us), a joint institute of CSIC and the [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/) in Santander, Spain. He earned his PhD in theoretical physics in 2009 at the Laboratoire de Physique Théorique in Orsay, France, and held postdoctoral positions at APC in Paris, IAS in Orsay, and the University of Manchester in the UK before moving to Spain.

His research revolves around the extraction and interpretation of new cosmological observables from submillimetre and radio observations of the Universe, primarily out of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. A key challenge in this field is the "component separation" problem, where astrophysical foreground emissions obscure much of the cosmological information. Remazeilles has developed several leading component separation methods in cosmology to tackle this issue, such as the Constrained ILC and GNILC techniques, which have become standard references in the community for the analysis of various CMB and radio data, including those from the ESA's [Planck mission](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck). He has also produced and released several public maps in astronomy, including the Planck map of thermal Sunyaez-Zeldovich effect, the Planck maps of cosmic infrared background anisotropies, the Planck maps of Galactic dust emission, as well as the Reprocessed Haslam 408 MHz all-sky map, which are all used worldwide and form an important part of the Planck legacy.

His current research includes the search for primordial CMB B-modes as evidence of primordial gravitational waves generated during cosmic inflation, a fraction of a second after the Big Bang; mapping thermal, kinetic, and relativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects to probe baryonic and dark matter in galaxy clusters; investigating tiny CMB spectral distortions caused by CMB–matter interactions at pre-recombination epochs; and seeking the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations in cosmological hydrogen 21-cm line emission. He is involved in several major upcoming CMB and radio experiments including LiteBIRD, QUIJOTE, SO, PICO, BISOU, and BINGO, which aim to shed light on these elusive components of the Universe.
