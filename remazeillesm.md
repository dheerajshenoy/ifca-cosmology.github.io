# Mathieu Remazeilles

Mathieu Remazeilles is a Tenured Scientist (Científico Titular) for the [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/es). He conducts his research in Cosmology at [IFCA](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us), a joint institute of the CSIC and the [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/) in Santander, Spain. He earned his PhD in theoretical physics in 2009 at the Laboratoire de Physique Théorique in Orsay, France, and held postdoctoral positions at APC in Paris, IAS in Orsay, and the University of Manchester in the UK before moving to Spain.

His research revolves around the extraction and interpretation of new cosmological observables from submillimetre and radio observations of the early Universe, primarily out of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. A key challenge in this field is the "component separation" problem, where astrophysical foreground emissions obscure much of the cosmological information. Remazeilles has developed several leading component separation methods in cosmology to tackle this issue, such as the "Constrained ILC" and "GNILC" algorithms, which have become standard references in the community for the analysis of various CMB and radio data, including those from the ESA's [Planck satellite mission](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck). He has also produced and released several public maps in Astronomy, including the Planck map of thermal Sunyaez-Zeldovich effect, the Planck maps of cosmic infrared background anisotropies, the Planck maps of Galactic dust emission, as well as the Reprocessed Haslam 408 MHz all-sky map, which are all used worldwide and form an important part of the Planck legacy.

Remazeilles' current research includes the search for primordial CMB B-modes, as the footprint of primordial gravitational waves from the cosmic inflation epoch, a fraction of a second after the Big Bang; the mapping of thermal, kinetic, and relativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects to probe baryonic and dark matter from galaxy clusters; the search for tiny CMB spectral distortions caused by various CMB-matter interactions at pre-recombination epochs; and the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations in the cosmological 21-cm line emission due to hydrogen abundance in the Universe. He is involved in several major upcoming CMB and radio experiments including LiteBIRD, QUIJOTE, PICO, CMB-S4, BISOU, and BINGO, which aim to shed light on these elusive components of the Universe.
