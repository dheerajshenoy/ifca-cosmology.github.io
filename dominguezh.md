# Helena Domínguez Sánchez

Dr. Helena Domínguez Sánchez  is a Ramón y Cajal fellow at IFCA. She works on Galaxy evolution, from an observational point of view using large astronomical surveys. 

The ultimate aim of her research is to understand how and why the properties of galaxies have changed across the history of the Universe, with a particular emphasis on their star formation histories and their morphological  transformations. During the last years, she developed expertise in the fascinating and hot topic of machine learning and she is a pioneer on the use of Deep Learning techniques in astronomy. Since 2023 she is an active member of the ARRAKIHS mission consortia, where she plays a pivotal role.

She was born in Salamanca but has lived in many cities around the world. She obtained her PhD in Bologna (2012) and then worked as post-doc in Tenerife, Madrid, Paris, Philadelphia, Barcelona and Teruel.
