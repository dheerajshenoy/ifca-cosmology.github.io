## Diego Herranz

I am currently a Full Professor at the [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/), where I conduct research at the [Instituto de Física de Cantabria (IFCA)](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us) and collaborate with the Observational Cosmology and Instrumentation group. My primary research interests lie in cosmology and the statistical analysis of signals and images, particularly focusing on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and extragalactic compact sources (galaxies and galaxy clusters). A major part of my work involves the detection and detailed study of astrophysical components, especially the identification and analysis of compact polarized point sources, both to reduce their impact on cosmological signals as contaminants and to study them as probes of galactic formation and evolution.

I actively participate in several [international collaborations]({{site.url}}/collabs/). I am involved in the [QUIJOTE](https://research.iac.es/proyecto/quijote/pages/en/home.php) and [LiteBIRD](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/future/litebird.html) experiments, both dedicated to studying the CMB. In these projects, I lead the development of software pipelines for detecting and characterizing polarized point sources. Additionally, I contribute to the ARRAKIHS mission, which aims to explore the ultra-low surface brightness universe to investigate dark matter, where I serve as the head of the Science Data Center (SDC). I'm also part of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) working group of the [SKA](https://www.skao.int/en). In the past, I contributed to the [Planck collaboration](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck), focusing on data analysis techniques and the detection of extragalactic compact sources. I also participated in the H-ATLAS project within ESA’s [Herschel](https://sci.esa.int/web/herschel) mission and the [J-PAS](https://www.j-pas.org/) survey. Beyond my research, I am deeply committed to science outreach and the promotion of scientific culture. I am a proud member of [Big Van Ciencia](https://www.bigvanciencia.com/).
