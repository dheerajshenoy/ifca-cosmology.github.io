# Biuse Casaponsa

I'm Biuse and I currently work in scientific project management, coordinating the Project Office of the ARRAKIHS space mission. Before moving to management, I was a researcher focused on cosmological data analyses. I did my PhD at the Instituto de FÃ­sica de Cantabria, and I had the change to do enriching research stays at the Cavendish Laboratory and Kavli Institute in Cambridge and at the Institute for Astronomy of Edinburgh. Later, as a postdoc, I worked within the Planck collaboration and the QUIJOTE experiment. Beyond academia, I have worked as a data analysis consultant and I am co-founder of Deduce Data Solutions, a company created to transfer advanced data analysis techniques from research into the business sector.
