The Observational Cosmology and Instrumentation group at IFCA focuses on the study of several topics related to the origin, components and evolution of the Universe. The research lines explored by members of the group are quite broad and varied, with special emphasis on observational and experimental initiatives and their connection with theoretical astrophysics and fundamental physics. In the group we account for the analysis and interpretation of cosmological observations, as well as for the design and development of instrumental devices to perform such measurements.

You can find an up-to-date (although potentially partial) list of the articles written by members of the group in [ADS](link-here) and [InspireHEP](link-here).

The Institute of Physics of Cantabria (IFCA) is a Joint Centre with the combined effort of two institutions, [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/en) and [University of Cantabria (UC)](https://web.unican.es/)  focused on basic-science research. In addition to cosmology, there are groups focused on X-ray astrophysics, particle physics, computational and data science, meteorology and statistical and non-linear physics.
