# Marcos Cruz

My current research focuses on: Cosmological data analysis, CMB, Statistics and Machine learning applications in cosmology.

Previously, my research centered on CMB data analysis, particularly the CMB cold spot, followed by work on isotropy and statistics as a Core Team member of the ESA Planck Mission. For several years, I was in the Statistics Department leading research in stereology (CountEm project: countem.unican.es). Now back in the Physics Department, I'm combining this diverse expertise in a new research direction.
