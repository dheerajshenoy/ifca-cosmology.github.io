# José Luis Bernal

I'm Jose, and work as a theoretical physicist interested in cosmology and astrophysics with a Ramón y Cajal Fellow position. Before moving back to Spain, I earned my PhD title at the [Institute of Cosmos Sciences](https://icc.ub.edu/) in the University of Barcelona (ICC-UB), Spain, under the supervision of [Prof. Licia Verde](https://liciaverde.icc.ub.edu/), worked as a Davis Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Department of Physics and Astronomy of Johns Hopkins University](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/) in Baltimore, US, working primarily with the group of [Prof. Marc Kamionkowski](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/kamionkowski/), and spent few months as a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/) in Garching, Germany, working within the physical cosmology group led by [Prof. Eiichiro Komatsu](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~komatsu/).

Mainly, I work on the interface between theoretical and observational cosmology, with special interest in improving the modeling of observables and optimizing the information return from cosmological observations. During the last years, my interests have been increasingly overlapping with extragalactic astrophysics, working on probes like line-intensity mapping that are sensitive both to cosmology and astrophysics. I also have dedicated much work and thought to tensions between cosmological observations and agnostic approaches to analyze their measurements, as well as to the phenomenology of dark matter models beyond CDM.

Beyond my research, I am deeply committed to science outreach and the promotion of scientific culture: I have participated in several workshops and activities for school and high-school students; and I have given several public talks for general public. Currently, I am the representative of the Cosmology group in the IFCA outreach efforts.
