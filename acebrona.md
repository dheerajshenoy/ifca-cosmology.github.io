# Ana Acebr√≥n

I have been working at IFCA as a Beatriz Galindo Junior Fellow since December 2023. Before that, I have held a Marie Curie Individual Fellowship in Milan, Italy (with Claudio Grillo) and a postdoctoral position in Be'er Sheva, Israel (with Adi Zitrin). I obtained my PhD in Astrophysics and Cosmology in 2017, at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, under the supervision of Eric Jullo. 


My research focuses on the study of strong lensing galaxy clusters, in particular those showing multiple images of time-varying sources, such as supernovae or quasars. While very few (about ten) such systems are currently known (this will soon change thanks to Euclid and Rubin-LSST!), they hold a sheer potential for cosmology, being the only probe that can simultaneously measure the values of the Hubble Constant, the matter density, dark energy density, and dark energy equation-of-state parameters! In particular, the time delays between time-varying multiple images offer and alternative and elegant way of measuring the cosmic expansion rate, completely independent of the distance ladder or the CMB. By leveraging high-quality, multi-wavelength datasets, we are able to build secure, large samples of cluster members and multiple images. These key ingredients are crucial to develop, in turn, high-precision strong lensing models of galaxy clusters, forming the base for robust dark matter studies and cosmological analyses.


I am involved in several key collaborations, exploiting HST and JWST high-resolution imaging of unique lenses, as well in the Euclid and Rubin-LSST wide-field surveys.
